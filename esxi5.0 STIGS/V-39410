#Description: Remote logging to a central log host provides a secure, centralized store for ESXi logs. By gathering host log files onto a central host it can more easily monitor all hosts with a single tool. It can also do aggregate analysis and searching to look for such things as coordinated attacks on multiple hosts. Logging to a secure, centralized log server also helps prevent log tampering and also provides a long-term audit record.
#Rule Title: The operating system must protect the audit records resulting from non-local accesses to privileged accounts and the execution of privileged functions.
#Version: SRG-OS-000217-ESXI5

#Check Content: Verify the vSphere Syslog Collector syslog host has been configured. From the vSphere Client:  Select the host and click "Configuration >> Advanced Settings >> Syslog >> Global". Verify the 'Syslog.global.logHost' is set to the (site-specific) syslog server hostname.

#If the 'Syslog.global.logHost' is unconfigured, this is a finding.


#Fix Text: Step 1:  Verify the vSphere Syslog Collector syslog host has been configured. If not, install/enable the vSphere Syslog Collector.
#Step 2:  From the vSphere Client:  Select the host and click "Configuration >> Advanced Settings >> Syslog >> Global".  
#Step 3: Set 'Syslog.global.logHost' to the syslog server hostname.
