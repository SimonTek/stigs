#Severity: medium
#Description: The log files generated by rsyslog contain valuable information regarding system configuration, user authentication, and other such information. Log files should be protected from unauthorized access.
#Rule Title: All rsyslog-generated log files must be owned by root.
#Version: RHEL-06-000133

#Check Content: The owner of all log files written by "rsyslog" should be root. These log files are determined by the second part of each Rule line in "/etc/rsyslog.conf" and typically all appear in "/var/log". For each log file [LOGFILE] referenced in "/etc/rsyslog.conf", run the following command to inspect the file's owner: 

#$ ls -l [LOGFILE]

#If the owner is not root, this is a finding.


#Fix Text: The owner of all log files written by "rsyslog" should be root. These log files are determined by the second part of each Rule line in "/etc/rsyslog.conf" typically all appear in "/var/log". For each log file [LOGFILE] referenced in "/etc/rsyslog.conf", run the following command to inspect the file's owner:

#$ ls -l [LOGFILE]

#If the owner is not "root", run the following command to correct this:

# chown root [LOGFILE]
