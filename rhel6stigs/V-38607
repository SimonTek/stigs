#Group Title: SRG-OS-000112
#Version: RHEL-06-000227
#Severity: high
#Description: SSH protocol version 1 suffers from design flaws that result in security vulnerabilities and should not be used.
#Rule Title: The SSH daemon must be configured to use only the SSHv2 protocol.
#Version: RHEL-06-000227

#Check Content: To check which SSH protocol version is allowed, run the following command: 

# grep Protocol /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#If configured properly, output should be 
#Protocol 2
#If it is not, this is a finding.
#Fix Text: Only SSH protocol version 2 connections should be permitted. The default setting in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" is correct, and can be verified by ensuring that the following line appears: 
#Protocol 2

if grep Protocol /etc/ssh/sshd_config|grep -v "^#"|grep 2; then
echo "This machine is RHEL-06-000004 Compliant" >> /var/log/Stig
echo "This machine is RHEL-06-000004 Compliant"
else
echo "This machine isn't RHEL-06-000004 Compliant" >> /var/log/Stig
echo "This machine isn't RHEL-06-000004 Compliant"
 grep -q ^Protocol /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \
  sed -i "s/Protocol.*/Protocol 2/g" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
if ! [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Protocol 2" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
