#Severity: medium
#Description: The total storage for audit log files must be large enough to retain log information over the period required. This is a function of the maximum log file size and the number of logs retained.
#Rule Title: The system must set a maximum audit log file size.
#Version: RHEL-06-000160

#Check Content: Inspect "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" and locate the following line to determine how much data the system will retain in each audit log file: "# grep max_log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf" 

#max_log_file = 6


#If the system audit data threshold hasn't been properly set up, this is a finding.


#Fix Text: Determine the amount of audit data (in megabytes) which should be retained in each log file. Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Add or modify the following line, substituting the correct value for [STOREMB]: 

#max_log_file = [STOREMB]

#Set the value to "6" (MB) or higher for general-purpose systems. Larger values, of course, support retention of even more audit data.

if grep max_log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf| grep 6; then
echo "This machine is RHEL-06-000160 Compliant" >> /var/log/Stig
echo "This machine is RHEL-06-000160 Compliant"
else
echo "This machine isn't RHEL-06-000160 Compliant" >> /var/log/Stig
echo "This machine isn't RHEL-06-000160 Compliant"
sed -i 's@max_log_file@^#max_log_file@g' /etc/audit/auditd.conf
echo "max_log_file = 6" >> /etc/audit/auditd.conf
fi
