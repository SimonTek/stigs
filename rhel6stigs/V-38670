#Version: RHEL-06-000306
#Severity: medium
#Description: By default, AIDE does not install itself for periodic execution. Periodically running AIDE may reveal unexpected changes in installed files.
#Rule Title: The operating system must detect unauthorized changes to software and information. 
#Version: RHEL-06-000306

#Check Content: To determine that periodic AIDE execution has been scheduled, run the following command: 
# grep aide /etc/crontab
#If there is no output, this is a finding.
#Fix Text: AIDE should be executed on a periodic basis to check for changes. To implement a daily execution of AIDE at 4:05am using cron, add the following line to /etc/crontab: 
#05 4 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide --check
#AIDE can be executed periodically through other means; this is merely one example.

if grep aide /etc/crontab; then
echo "This machine is RHEL-06-000306 Compliant" >> /var/log/Stig
echo "This machine is RHEL-06-000306 Compliant"
else
echo "This machine isn't RHEL-06-000306 Compliant" >> /var/log/Stig
echo "This machine isn't RHEL-06-000306 Compliant"
echo "05 4 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide --check" >> /etc/crontab
fi
