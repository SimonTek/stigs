#Group Title: SRG-OS-000064
#Version: RHEL-06-000192
#Severity: low
#Description: The changing of file permissions could indicate that a user is attempting to gain access to information that would otherwise be disallowed. Auditing DAC modifications can facilitate the identification of patterns of abuse among both authorized and unauthorized users.
#Rule Title: The audit system must be configured to audit all discretionary access control permission modifications using lchown.
#Version: RHEL-06-000192

#Check Content: To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the "lchown" system call, run the following command: 

# auditctl -l | grep syscall | grep lchown
#If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return several lines. 
#If no lines are returned, this is a finding.
#Fix Text: At a minimum, the audit system should collect file permission changes for all users and root. Add the following to "/etc/audit/audit.rules": 
#-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S lchown -F auid>=500 -F auid!=4294967295 \
#-k perm_mod
#-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S lchown -F auid==0 -k perm_mod

if auditctl -l | grep syscall | grep lchown; then
echo "This machine is RHEL-06-000192 Compliant" >> /var/log/Stig
echo "This machine is RHEL-06-000192 Compliant"
else
echo "This machine isn't RHEL-06-000192 Compliant" >> /var/log/Stig
echo "This machine isn't RHEL-06-000192 Compliant"
echo "-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S lchown -F auid>=500 -F auid!=4294967295 \ " >> /etc/audit/audit.rules
echo "-k perm_mod" >> /etc/audit/audit.rules
echo "-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S lchown -F auid==0 -k perm_mod" >> /etc/audit/audit.rules
fi
