#Group ID (Vulid): V-2258
#Group Title: WG290
#Rule ID: SV-33027r1_rule
#Severity: CAT I
#Rule Version (STIG-ID): WG290 A22
#Rule Title: Web client access to the content directories must be restricted to read and execute.
#Vulnerability Discussion: Excessive permissions for the anonymous web user account are one of the most common faults contributing to the compromise of a web server. If this user is able to upload and execute files on the web server, the organization or owner of the server will no longer have control of the asset.
#Responsibility: Web Administrator
#IAControls: ECLP-1
#To view the value of Alias enter the following command:
# grep "Alias" /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf
# Alias
# ScriptAlias
# ScriptAliasMatch
#Review the results to determine the location of the files listed above.
#Enter the following command to determine the permissions of the above file:
# ls -Ll /file-path
#The only accounts listed should be the web administrator, developers, and the account assigned to run the apache server service.
#If accounts that donâ€™t need access to these directories are listed, this is a finding.
#If the permissions assigned to the account for the Apache web server service is greater than Read & Execute (R_E), this is a finding.
#Fix Text: Assign the appropriate permissions to the applicable directories and files using the chmod command.
