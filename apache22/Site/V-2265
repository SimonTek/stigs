#Group Title: WG490
#Rule ID: SV-33032r1_rule
#Severity: CAT III
#Rule Version (STIG-ID): WG490 A22
#Rule Title: Java software on production web servers must be limited to class files and the JAVA virtual machine.
#Vulnerability Discussion: From the source code in a .java or a .jpp file, the Java compiler produces a binary file with an extension of .class. The .java or .jpp file would, therefore, reveal sensitive information regarding an applicationâ€™s logic and permissions to resources on the server. By contrast, the .class file, because it is intended to be machine independent, is referred to as bytecode. Bytecodes are run by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), or the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), via a browser configured to permit Java code.
#Responsibility: Web Administrator
#IAControls: ECSC-1
#Enter the commands:
# find / -name *.java
# find / -name *.jpp
#If either file type is found, this is a finding.
#Fix Text: Remove the unnecessary files from the web server.
